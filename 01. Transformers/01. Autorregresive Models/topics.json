        "Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive knowledge from vast amounts of text through pretraining, enabling remarkable performance in various natural language tasks, particularly text generation. This knowledge acquisition leverages the distributional hypothesis, where word meanings are learned from co-occurrence patterns in text, even without direct instruction or real-world grounding. Vocabulary acquisition, a complex process, primarily occurs indirectly through reading and text processing, highlighting the importance of contextual learning and the distributional hypothesis.",
        "LLMs are built using the Transformer architecture, which employs self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of words in a sequence, capturing long-range dependencies without the limitations of recurrent models. The Transformer architecture, consisting of encoder-decoder or decoder-only blocks, has become the standard for LLMs due to its efficiency and parallel processing capabilities. Language models typically use a decoder-only architecture, where the input is a sequence of tokens, and the output is a prediction of the next token along with contextual embeddings.",
        "A key component in transformers is the residual stream, a series of d-dimensional representations that are continuously refined as they pass through layers. Outputs from feedforward and attention layers are added to the residual stream, enabling information flow from lower to higher layers and maintaining dimensional consistency throughout the network. Transformer blocks, fundamental units of the architecture, are composed of self-attention layers, feedforward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization, stacked repeatedly to build deep networks and process input tokens iteratively."

        "The Transformer architecture utilizes self-attention mechanisms to build contextual representations of words by integrating information from neighboring words across extensive text spans. Self-attention allows the network to extract and use information from arbitrarily large contexts by combining linear layers, feedforward networks, and self-attention layers, enabling efficient parallel computation unlike recurrent networks. The intuition behind the transformer is to build richer contextualized representations through a series of layers, combining information from previous layers with neighboring words to produce contextualized meanings for each word.",
        "Self-attention computes contextual representations by combining a word's previous layer representation with representations of neighboring words, using weights to determine the degree of integration.  Self-attention mechanisms use a combination of query, key, and value vectors derived from the input embeddings to weigh and combine representations of different words, allowing the model to capture linguistic relationships within the context.  Input words play three roles in self-attention: query (current focus), key (preceding input for comparison), and value (used to compute output).",
        "The attention process involves projecting each input vector into a query, key, and value space by multiplying them by weight matrices (WQ, WK, WV), respectively. The score between a current focus and context is a dot product between the projected query and key.  The dot product between queries and keys calculates the similarity or relevance between words. Self-attention scores are computed as dot products between queries and keys, and normalized with softmax to generate a weight vector. The softmax function transforms the scores into normalized weights, used to weight the value vectors generating contextual representations and produce a probability distribution representing the relevance of each input word.",
        "Multihead attention enhances self-attention by using multiple sets of attention layers to capture diverse relations between words. It projects inputs through multiple key, query, and value matrices to learn different relationships, and then concatenates and projects these outputs into the desired output dimension. Multihead attention uses multiple sets of attention layers, projecting inputs through multiple key, query, and value matrices to learn different relationships, then concatenating and projecting these outputs to the desired output dimension.",
        "The output of self-attention is a weighted sum of the value vectors, capturing information from different words. In causal (left-to-right) language modeling, masking prevents self-attention from accessing future words, ensuring word probability is based only on previous words.  'Causal attention' (or 'backward-looking') considers only prior words to predict the next, crucial for autoregressive language modeling. The self-attention mechanism involves comparisons via dot products, softmax normalization for probability distribution, and a weighted sum of input vectors using this distribution."

By packing token input embeddings into a single matrix X and multiplying by key, query, and value matrices, Q, K, and V matrices are obtained. All dot-product scores are then computed in one step using matrix operations. This matrix multiplication approach reduces the self-attention computation to a single operation involving Q, K, and V, enabling parallel processing of entire token sequences in one step, enhancing efficiency.",
        "In causal language modeling, masking is essential to prevent self-attention from accessing future words. The masking process involves setting upper triangle elements of the attention score matrix to negative infinity. After applying the softmax function, these values become zero, ensuring the model does not look into the future when predicting the next word in a sequence."

These blocks are stacked repeatedly to build deep networks. The overall process within a transformer block involves self-attention, residual connection, layer normalization, feedforward network, and another residual connection with layer normalization, maintaining dimensional consistency throughout.",
        "Self-attention layers within a transformer block enable the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. Following the self-attention layer, feedforward layers apply position-wise networks to each token's representation independently and in parallel, typically using a hidden layer with larger dimensionality than the model dimensionality. These feedforward layers are position-wise networks with weights that are the same across positions but different between Transformer layers, adding non-linearities and modeling capacity.",
        "Residual connections are crucial for training deep networks. They add the input of a layer to its output, bypassing intermediate layers and allowing information to flow directly from lower to higher layers. This direct flow improves learning, prevents the vanishing gradient problem, and provides higher-level layers with direct access to lower-level data. Layer normalization is used to normalize vectors in each layer, stabilizing training and accelerating convergence. It normalizes each input vector based on mean and standard deviation, keeping values in a suitable range for gradient-based training. Normalizing layers, like layer norm, improve training performance by maintaining hidden layer values in a range facilitating gradient-based training."

They can be derived from an embedding matrix or calculated with one-hot vectors. Positional embeddings, added to token embeddings, represent the position of a word in the sequence, allowing the model to understand sequence order. Positional embeddings capture the position of each word and can be absolute or relative, learned during training or defined by a static function.",
        "Token embeddings are created by converting tokens into vocabulary indices and using these indices to select corresponding rows from an embedding matrix, representing the embedding for that specific token. Token embeddings are vectors that represent individual words or sub-word units, stored in the embedding matrix, which has a row for each token in the vocabulary. The input for the transformer is an embedding matrix composed of token embeddings and positional embeddings. The input matrix to the transformer is obtained by summing up the token and positional embeddings, allowing the model to interpret both semantics and sequence information, creating a combined embedding.",
        "Positional embeddings can be absolute, learned along with other parameters during training and combined with token embeddings through addition. Absolute positional embeddings add learned representations for each possible position in the input sequence. Alternatively, positional embeddings can be relative or use static functions to map integers to vectors, capturing relationships between positions. The simplest positional embedding method is creating absolute embeddings, distinct and randomly initialized for each model position. More sophisticated embeddings can use static functions mapping integers to real-valued vectors to capture position relationships."

This component maps the final layer embedding to a probability distribution, involving projecting the output of the last Transformer layer to the vocabulary space through a linear mapping and softmax function. The language modeling head projects the final Transformer layer's output into a logit vector with a score for each word in the vocabulary. Logits are then converted to probabilities using the softmax function, enabling the model to assign conditional probabilities to all possible next words.",
        "A softmax layer converts logits into probabilities over the vocabulary. The softmax function normalizes logits to generate a probability distribution, squashing scores into a probabilistic range (0-1), emphasizing higher scores and deemphasizing lower scores. The probability of each word in the vocabulary is calculated via the softmax function, normalizing logits to generate a probability distribution.",
        "The language modeling head maps the final transformer block's output to a probability distribution over all words, using the transposed embedding matrix (unembedding layer) to project from output to logit scores. A common practice is 'weight tying', where weights in the language modeling head's projection are tied (equal) to the input embedding matrix. 'Weight tying' uses the transpose of the input embedding matrix as the output linear layer, ensuring the model is proficient in both mappings. Weight tying, commonly used in the language modeling head, makes the unembedding layer the transpose of the input embedding matrix, used for mapping from a one-hot vector to an embedding, and then from an embedding to logits. Weight tying uses the same weight matrix for word embeddings and logit scores, improving parameter efficiency, where the model learns a representation for each word usable for both input and output stages."

        "The core of text generation in large language models is choosing the next word (decoding), based on context and probabilities assigned by the model. The process involves choosing words to be generated, based on conditional probabilities and decoding the model autoregressively. Autoregressive generation is a process where the next word is chosen conditioned on previously chosen words, used left-to-right during decoding. Autoregressive generation is repeatedly choosing the next word based on prior choices and model probabilities, generating text left to right. Decoding is choosing the next word to generate, based on context and model-assigned probabilities.",
        "Sampling is a common decoding method, choosing words randomly based on their probabilities from the model. Sampling is the most common decoding method, meaning choosing random words based on model-assigned probability. Common sampling methods avoid unlikely words and allow control over quality-diversity tradeoff. Various sampling methods exist to improve upon random sampling and avoid generating unlikely words. Random sampling chooses words from the model's probability distribution, but often produces nonsensical output due to improbable words, sacrificing text quality for diversity. Random sampling picks words directly from the model's distribution and can be improved via methods to prevent unlikely word generation.",
        "Several sampling techniques enhance text quality and diversity. 'Random sampling' involves choosing words randomly according to the model's probability distribution, which can lead to strange, low-probability generations. 'Top-k sampling' truncates the word distribution to the 'k' most probable and samples from them. 'Top-k sampling' selects the k most likely words and resamples according to their distribution. 'Top-k sampling' truncates the probability distribution to the k most probable words and rescales it, then samples from this distribution, balancing diversity and text quality by restricting options to the most relevant.  'Nucleus (top-p)' sampling truncates the distribution to retain words comprising 'p' percent of probability mass, adapting dynamically to different contexts. Nucleus or top-p sampling keeps the top p percent of probability mass, dynamically varying considered tokens, making it more robust than fixed-k in top-k across contexts. Nucleus (top-p) sampling is similar to Top-k, but truncates distribution to the top p percent of probability mass, adapting to context shapes and allowing a more dynamic word pool.",
        "Temperature sampling rescales logit scores with a parameter to control word probability distribution, allowing more diverse or conservative generations. Temperature sampling rescales logits by a temperature parameter before softmax, modulating distribution, reducing randomness at low temperatures and increasing it at high temperatures. Temperature sampling reshapes distribution, increasing probable word likelihood at low temperature and flattening distribution at high temperature. Low temperatures in temperature sampling make the model more 'confident', increasing high-probability word chances. 'Temperature sampling' adjusts the distribution shape, increasing or decreasing likely word probability. Lower temperature makes distribution greedier, higher temperature makes it more diverse.",
        "For text generation with language models, a simple method is 'greedy decoding', where the model always chooses the word with the highest probability given the context. However, greedy decoding, while simple, often results in generic and repetitive text, and is typically avoided. An improvement over greedy decoding is 'sampling'. In sampling, the next word is chosen randomly according to the probabilities given by the model. This method yields more diverse texts but may generate rarer words. An enhanced variation is 'top-k sampling', defining a number k of candidate words, from which the model chooses one of the k most probable. Another sampling improvement is 'top-p sampling' or 'nucleus sampling', choosing the smallest set of words whose probability sum equals or exceeds a given p. This results in more diverse and higher-probability texts. 'Temperature sampling' further refines this by adjusting probabilities, smoothing or sharpening the model's distribution."

Loss is computed based on model predictions of the next word at each step and backpropagated, adjusting the model to minimize cross-entropy loss during training. Cross-entropy loss is used to measure the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the correct distribution, measuring the negative log probability of the correct next word. The cross-entropy loss function compares the predicted probability distribution with the correct (one-hot) next word distribution, quantifying the difference.

        "Components like feedforward and attention add new views to the representation in each layer. Multihead attention is the only component receiving information from other tokens in context. Attention heads can be viewed as moving information from other 'residual streams' to the current 'residual stream'. Token representations contain information about the current token and neighboring tokens. The residual stream metaphor emphasizes the fact that multi-head attention moves information from the residual stream of a neighboring token into the current token’s stream.",
        "A variation of the transformer architecture, the prenorm architecture, applies layer norm before attention and feedforward layers. In prenorm transformer architecture, layer norm is applied before the attention layer and feedforward layer. The 'prenorm' transformer architecture performs layer normalization before attention and feedforward layers, while 'postnorm' normalizes after each. Prenorm architecture generally performs better in many situations. In both cases, the last Transformer layer has a normalization. Prenorm architecture changes information flow and impacts performance."
